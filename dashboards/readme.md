# Dashboards and Embedding ThousandEyes Widgets

ThousandEyes dashboard widgets can be embedded directly into an AppDynamics dasboard.

To do this, simply use the URL from the **Embed Widget** menu in a widget that is part of an existing ThousandEyes dashboard.

**Note** - Only the URL is needed, not the full iframe code.

Paste the URL into an AppDynamics dashboard widget under the **URL to display** field in an AppDynamics widget. Make sure **Security Sandbox IFrame** is unchecked.
