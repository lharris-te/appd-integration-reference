# Native Alerts Integration

ThousandEyes natively supports sending alert notifications directly to AppDynamics. You can set up alert notifications using the AppDynamics notification drop-down in ThousandEyes. To learn more about the native alerts integration, see the official [ThousandEyes Documentation](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts/integrations/appdynamics-integration). 

In AppDynamics, ThousandEyes alerts show up as custom events of type `ThousandEyesAlert`. 

The **thousandeyes-alert-template.json** file shows an example of an AppDynamics alert policy that is triggered by ThousandEyes alerts.
